title: Stern
description: The Homeguard Naval Institution's most recent contribution to the Union Navy, the Stern-class siege battlecruiser brings extreme resilience and firepower to bear at the cost of mobility. The Stern has had a troubled upbringing from the start; plagued by misallocated RnD funds, bureaucratic red tape, scrutiny from naval officers higher up the food chain, and a plethora of other issues before it actually hit the shipyards in Chengridz. Suffering from a poor availability of defensive technology in turn, shielded only by a NT-280 class Errant deflector system - originally reserved for heavy fighters and corvettes - and instead relying on redundant wiring, thick plastitanium plating, and a dual-core AME setup to survive extended sieges. Now pair it with a good escort squad.
