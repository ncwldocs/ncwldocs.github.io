title: Krechet
description: A super-interdictor used primarily by the Coreward Militias in Chengridz, exported to Taypan in small volume for use in sophisticated hit-and-run attacks. With dual vulcans and dual missile pods loaded with EMP tubes, the Krechet excels at immobilizing and catching smaller targets, able to operate for extended engagements on it's own without external fire support. Being a Militia-issue hull, these are found in limited supply in the Sector.
