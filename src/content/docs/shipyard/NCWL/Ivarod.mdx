title: Ivarod
description: A low-tech bruiser frigate in encumbering plastitanium. Most of the internal electronics work has been torn out in favor of more armor plating and more gun mounts, leaving little space for a shield generator. Ivarod-classes are commonly deployed as fleet anchors in patrol squadrons or as frontliners in large-scale engagements, equipped with a variety of explosive ballistics to make short work of a variety of weight classes.
