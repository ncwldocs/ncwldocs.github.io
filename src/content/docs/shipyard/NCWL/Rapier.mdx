> *Originally a Wasp-class Imperial mining pod, the Rapier has gotten a second lease on life with thruster overclocking, a brand-new engine block, and two heatseeking torpedoes to replace its mining beam lasers. Used primarily in harassment raids and precision strikes, the Rapier doesn't tend to survive for long on its own.*


## Armaments

* 2x SHI 180mm 'Idna' light torpedo pods

## Modules

* Module A: Fire Torpedoes 
* Module B: Blank 
* Module C: Blank 
* Module D: Blank 
* Module E: Blank


## Notes

Should be used only for bombing runs against large or slow-moving targets. No defensive capabilities against other ultralights. Escort it with a fighter or keep it very close to its carrier.
