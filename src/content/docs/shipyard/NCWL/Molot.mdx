title: Molot
description: A high-maintenance missile and early-warning radar corvette. The Molot is uncommon in the sense that rather than using heavy armor plating as is standard with most NCWL designs, it instead boasts a low-performance NT-280 Errant deflector system as it's primary method of defense, it's electronics interface and power reactor upgraded in line with modern standards as a result. Although costly, the Molot retains it's position in the Homeguard Navy as an effective fire support and shield breacher.
