title: Cherenzikov
description: A robust civilian-military conversion, the Cherenzikov is a cheap, low-tech adaptation of an existing miner-freighter model belonging to Ihikerja Civilian Manufacturing. Used primarily as a heavy patrol corvette, its ease of manufacture and low material cost renders it an effective choice for aspiring Unionkapitans looking to make a name for themselves.
