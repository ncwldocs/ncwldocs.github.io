title: Rapier
description: A glass coffin to die in. The Rapier-class is a cored-out mining drone originally rated for firing depth charges into large chunks of asteroid rock, later repurposed into a penal torpedo bomber to stuff misbehaving pilots into. It'll kill. Whether you survive after is another matter.
